Dual Palindromes
Mario Cruz (Colombia) & Hugo Rickeboer (Argentina)
A number that reads the same from right to left as when read from left to right is called a palindrome. The number 12321 is a palindrome; the number 77778 is not. Of course, palindromes have neither leading nor trailing zeroes, so 0220 is not a palindrome.

The number 21 (base 10) is not palindrome in base 10, but the number 21 (base 10) is, in fact, a palindrome in base 2 (10101).

Write a program that reads two numbers (expressed in base 10):

N (1 <= N <= 15)
S (0 < S < 10000)
and then finds and prints (in base 10) the first N numbers strictly greater than S that are palindromic when written in two or more number bases (2 <= base <= 10).
Solutions to this problem do not require manipulating integers larger than the standard 32 bits.

PROGRAM NAME: dualpal
INPUT FORMAT
A single line with space separated integers N and S.

SAMPLE INPUT (file dualpal.in)
3 25
OUTPUT FORMAT
N lines, each with a base 10 number that is palindromic when expressed in at least two of the bases 2..10. The numbers should be listed in order from smallest to largest.
